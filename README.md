# Maintenance Week

Every time I have spoken to engineers about COBOL, they have told me that COBOL
itself is far from the biggest challenge. The real challenge is working with
legacy or mature codebases. These tend to be large, complex, and unfamiliar.

This week you will learn and put into practice some techniques for working with
mature software projects. The projects you will encounter in work will very
likely be even larger than these.

## Learning objectives

* Learn that while mature software projects may seem intimidating at first, you
  can still understand and modify them with due care and effort.
* Learn to apply tests to control changes to mature software.
* Learn to trace execution through a complex system.
* Learn to diagram out a complex system to identify opportunities for change.

## Project 1: Gilded Rose

### Applying Tests

## Project 2: 2048

### Tracing Execution

## Project 3: ORCA

### Diagramming
